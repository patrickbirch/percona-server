New Features
================================================================================

- `Key rotation for the redo log <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`__ has been redesigned to rotate the key with `SELECT rotate_system_key("percona_redo")`. 

Bugs Fixed
================================================================================
- The :variable: `buf_dblwr_flush_buffered_writes` must crash the server when an I/O error occurs to the parallel doublewrite buffer. The doublewrite buffer error returns to the caller. Bug fixed :psbug:`5678`.
- After resetting the :variable:`innodb-temp-tablespace-encrypt` to `OFF` during runtime the subsequent file-per-table temporary tables continue to be encrypted. Bug fixed :psbug:`5734`.
- The `key rotation process <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`__ was redesigned. The updated process allows the key rotation with `SELECT rotate_system_key("percona_redo")` and the currently used key version is displayed in the `innodb_redo_key_version` variable.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5565`.
- Setting the encryption `ON` for the system tablespace generates an encryption key and encrypts system temporary tablespace pages. Resetting the encryption to `OFF`, all subsequent pages are written to the temporary tablespace without encryption. To allow any encrypted tables to be decrypted, the generated keys are not erased. Modifying the :variable:`innodb_temp_tablespace_encrypt` does not affect file-per-table temporary tables. This type of table is encrypted if `ENCRYPTION='y'` at table creation.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5736`.
- An instance started with the default values but setting the redo log to encrypt without specifying the keyring plugin parameters does not fail or throw an error.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5476`.
- The :variable:`rocksdb_large_prefix` allows index key prefixes up to 3072 bytes. The default value is changed to `TRUE` to match the behavior of the :variable:`innodb_large_prefix`. :psbug:`5655 `.
- On a server with two million or more tables, a user experiences a shutdown in less than ten minutes.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5639`.
- The changed page tracking may read pages which have the encryption bit set.  The redo log does not have the encryption key and decryption fails and generates an error message. A `flag <https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-server/LATEST/management/data_at_rest_encryption.html>`__ lets the read process safely ignore encryption errors in this case.  Bug fixed :psbug:`5541`.
- Large page allocations with the :variable:`innodb_buffer_pool_chunk_size` set to a shared memory segment larger than 4GB or more generates an incorrect size. Bug fixed :psbug:`5517`.
- The TokuDB hot backup library continually dumps TRACE information to stdout.  The user cannot enable or disable the dump of this information. Bug fixed :psbug:`4850`.

Protecting Data with Encryption
=============================================================

Encryption is the practice of disguising data to make the data unintelligible to an unauthorized user. The data is stored securely on a digital device. Encryption does not prevent the unauthorized user from gaining access to the device, but ensures they cannot read the data.

The set of rules used to disguise the data is the encryption algorithm. To provide a method of reversing the encryption, the algorithm typically depends on an encryption key which is added to the algorithm at the time of encryption. The user with the encryption key can decrypt the data.
